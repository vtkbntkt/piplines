# Unique name for this workflow
name: Validate PR on develop branch

# Definition when the workflow should run
on: 
  # The workflow will run whenever an event happens on a pull request
  pull_request:
    # The events are that a PR is opened, or when a commit is pushed
    # to a branch that has an existing pull request
    types: [opened, synchronize]
    # The branches filter allows to specify that this workflow should only
    # run if the branch name is "development". This way we prevent this workflow
    # from running when PRs are opened on other branches
    branches: [development]
    # We only care about changes to the force-app directory, which is the
    # root directory of the sfdx project. This prevents the job from running
     # when changing non-salesforce files (like this yml file).
    paths:
      - 'force-app/**'

# Jobs to be executed when the above conditions are met
jobs:
  # This is the name of the job. You can give it whatever name you want
  validate-pr-on-developement:
    # As mentioned in the blog post, this job runs inside a VM. Here we
    # can specify which OS this VM should run on. 
    # In this case, we are going to run our commands on the latest version
    # of ubuntu
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # Dependabot is a GitHub bot that can create pull requests to update dependencies
    # This condition is used to skip the job or step when Dependabot triggers the workflow.
